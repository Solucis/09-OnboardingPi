["On Substack" About Page]([https://arc.net/](https://on.substack.com/about))

The content below is a remix of Substack’s about page for its publication, "On Substack". Our intention behind remixing this for our own purposes is to (1) give us a place to start for presenting a publication based on a service we admire and (2) promote the work that Substack does in hopes of driving more people to use the service.
