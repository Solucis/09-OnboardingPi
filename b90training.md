[The Browser Company | Building Arc](https://thebrowser.company/)

The content below is a remix of The Browser Company’s landing page to help our decentralized team understand our vision. The intention is to (1) give us a place to start for crafting our vision based on a company who has proven success and (2) promote the work The Browser Company does in hopes of driving more people to use their products.

>  What product are you creating? What category does it fit within? How can you describe it broadly enough to capture what you’re doing now and what you plan to do in the future? Replace [institution] with the broad category of the product that you're creating.

# This is a [conversation].

---

>  How can you describe your product offering in really simple terms? What you’re creating is amazing, but let’s describe it in words a 7 year old can understand. What words can you use to describe your product, replace [an idea] and [some rules and social norms] with how you can describe your product in a simple way.

# It’s just [an exchange], with [some words and phrases].

---

> Is your product a portal, gateway, bridge, etc? What does your product connect people to? What industry is your product associated with? Replace [mental model] and [in our cities] with something that resonates with your brand.

# It’s our [bridge] for everything [in the digital realm].

---

> Look at your previous responses, what did you replace [in our cities] with? Let’s keep that train of thought going. What do you think is the biggest pain point for people who are using whatever you replaced [in our cities] with? The word that you use to replace [overwhelming] (unless you want to keep that in place), will be the basis of the problem slide in the pitch deck that we create for your ecosystem. What problem do the people you serve face?
      
# We love [the digital realm], but [it] can be [a challeng finding clarity amid the vast sea of information].

---

> What do you want your product to allow people and companies to do? What do they want instead of the current problem that they’re facing? Replace [an institution] with your product category and [help us make light of it all] with the solution that you think you can provide that category.

# What if [a conversation] could [simplify complexities]?

---

> What are three benefits that you think your product will bring your customers? Look at some research articles and whitepapers related to your industry, in the first couple of paragraphs, they’ll most likely point out a couple of the industry’s biggest challenges? What are the positive alternatives that people in your industry want? Replace [an institution] with your product category, [presence], [collaboration], and [self-sovereign] with positive outcomes that your product will provide. Replace [promote] with whatever makes the sentence read properly.

# Could [a conversation] [keep us] [aligned], [centered], and [attuned]?

---

> Replace [ourStory: Everything Is Music] with your company name. Replace [design engineering] with any verb that describes how you want to bring your idea to the world. Replace [to build our cities] with a statement related to the industry you’re serving.

# At [Solucis Tech], we’re [forging] a better way [to illuminate our potential].

---

> Alright! That should give you everything you need to replace the rest of the bracketed words below with statements that align with your brand. Send a message to your onboarding agent if you have any questions.

When we think about [exploring the digital realm], we often ignore [the essence of the system] - the [conversation] itself. Instead, we think about all the things we do [in the digital domain]---[the articles we read], [the emails we send], [the shows we watch]. The [technology] that enables it all, [the coversation], is so ubiquitous that it’s ignored.

Despite the ways [our citywide planning] has evolved, [the institution] has remained relatively unchanged. While all of our [other social tools] are [innovating for the future]–with [machine learning], [blockchain technology], and [biomimicry innovation]---[the institution] largely still does what it did [since we started playing this game].

What’s more, we blame ourselves for [our conversational] shortcomings. When [a conversation] has [a disagreement], [we blame ourselves]; when [we messages are lost in translation], [we tell ourselves we're disconnected]; [when we can't come up with solutions], [we think we’re failures]. Why does [the conversation] get a free pass?

That’s why we’re building a new [conversation], which we call Bio-Optonomus Builder (BOB)], because we believe [conversations] can do so much more to empower us. We’re imagining [a conversation] that can [convey meaningful information], [streamline tasks], and [amplify our creativity]. [A conversation] equipped for the way we use [the digital realm] in 2023, and foundational for how we [aspire] to use them in the future.
